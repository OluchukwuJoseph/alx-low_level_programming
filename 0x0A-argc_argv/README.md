In this directory, we will be exploring 'Argc' and 'Argv'.
Both of this terms can be passed as parameters to the Main function to extend the capabilities of the Main Function.
Example:
    int main(int argc, char *argv[])

Argc means "Argument Counter" and Argv means "Argument Vector".
Argc is used to count the amount of strings passed in the command line.
Argv is an array used to store the string passed.
