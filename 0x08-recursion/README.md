In this directory, we will built some projects to further increase our knowledge on C recursion.

Recursion in c is simply calling a function in the function (while defining the function) . This can also be used as a loop. Just as a loop the Recursive function also has a condition that has to be met for before the recursion function will 'break', it is called 'Base condition'.
